# - qdrant: Qdrant vector database for semantic search
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up -d                  # Start all services
#   docker compose ps                     # Check service health
#   docker compose logs -f notebook-mcp   # View MCP server logs
#   docker compose down                   # Stop all services
#   docker compose down -v                # Stop and remove volumes
